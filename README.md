# Python Web Scraping Project 

## Project description

This Python script performs web scraping on the "Books to Scrape" website (https://books.toscrape.com/) to extract information about various books, including their names and prices. The python script utilizes the BeautifulSoup library for parsing HTML and the urllib library for fetching the web page.


## Data Collection

The data for this project was collected from 'http://books.toscrape.com/' website through web scraping.

## Data Processing 

The collected data was processed with some basic cleaning actions such as text normalisation , case adjustment and numerical value extraction .

## Database

The data was stored in SQlite database which is named as "books.db" which has only one table .


## Website 

Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that provides useful tools and features for creating web applications in the Python Language. SQLAlchemy is an SQL toolkit that provides efficient and high-performing database access for relational databases.
The Flask framework, along with the sqlalchemy package, was used to create a simple website. Our site has an About page describing user functionalities, and a Data Description page defining the data source and variable definitions. Users can search, update, and delete records from the database through the website.
